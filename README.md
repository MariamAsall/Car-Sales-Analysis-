# Car-Sales-Analysis-
This project provides an analysis of car sales data, focusing on various attributes such as customer demographics, Vehicle details , and sales performance. The analysis is conducted using Microsoft excel pivot tables, Dashboard, Python and Jupyter Notebook  leveraging libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and exploration

 # Data Description :
The dataset is a detailed record of car sales transactions, encompassing 23,906 entries with various attributes related to the sales process. It includes information on the cars sold, such as the model, company, engine type, transmission, and color, as well as details about the customers, including their names, genders, annual incomes, and regions. Additionally, the dataset records the specifics of each sale, including the price, date of sale, and dealership details. This data serves as a comprehensive source for analyzing car sales trends, customer demographics, and dealership performance, making it valuable for conducting in-depth analysis, data cleaning, and aggregation to derive meaningful insights.

**project.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook file that performs the data analysis. Key steps include:

1- Importing necessary libraries (pandas, numpy).
2- Loading the car sales data from a CSV file.
3- **Data exploration & Cleaning**: Checking the data structure and dimensions.
                                    Removing null values and duplicates.
                                    Dropping unnecessary columns.
                                    Creating a Year column.
                                    Converting the Date column to the correct data type.
4- **Data Aggregation** : Grouping columns for better analysis.
5- **Statistical Summary** : Displaying statistical summaries for both categorical and 
                             numerical data. 
6- **Business Questions** : Addressing business-related questions for data-driven decision- 
                            making.
